     * yaaraa.cpp: Fixed bug where deleting of analysis directory 
     temproary files for one recording was deleting ALL tmp files for 
     all recordings. In other words, all analysis of recordings after 
     the first were not happening because all recording files were 
     getting deleted after the first run.

     * install.sh: Now includes installation phase for GoogleTest
     framework. this framwork is installed to $SOUND_BASE_DIR/test/gtest

     * /test/gtest/dir.info: Added directory info file
